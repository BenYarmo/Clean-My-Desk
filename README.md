Here's my bad game!!

You're gonna get an error when it starts up--something like "the name SECRETS does not exist in the current context". Good! That means I didn't leave my Twitter secrets in here! If you're working on this with me in VGDEV I'll probably have the file available in our Discord. Don't worry about adding it to the project and accidentally saving it, the file name "SECRETS.cs" is in the gitignore, yay!
